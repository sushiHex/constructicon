# M8 implementation record

Status: PR A and hosted-runner decision merged; PR B under review.

Authority: [accepted ADR 0018](../../adr/0018-live-executors-are-leased-contained-processes.md)
and [frozen rev 1](../milestones/M8-live-executors-rev1.md). PR #26 merged as
`3ee1beb6a58fac0bab85841a1f34d96b514c3c34`, PR A's exact base. The merged
tree equals its reviewed head `8308cf8`. Approval does not provision Linux or
a gateway. Neither the frozen plan nor its planning evidence is edited here.

## PR A — contracts, coherence, and publication

The implementation adds no launcher, model adapter, credential handling,
gateway, Git lifecycle marker, or OS availability proof. Its production change
is the contract boundary; genuine fakes exercise its consumers.

- L0 owns one normalized finite `ExecutorGrantPolicy` and one pure itemized
  `ExecutorProfile.grant_faults`. Admission and the complete-policy fake call
  it. Historical `None` policy remains absent, not serialized as null, and
  the fake's default historical grant behavior remains unchanged.
- `ExecutorLaunchIdentity` binds executable/runtime, adapter/decoder, recipe,
  configuration, limits, complete single-posture profile, and optional
  `ProviderRouteIdentity`. Locators and credentials are not identity fields.
  The existing string capability revision is its canonical digest.
- The shared policy/identity source bodies contribute `EXECUTOR_LAW_REVISION`
  automatically, following the panel law's existing source-derived precedent.
  Backend factories still bind their own actual artifacts; they do not have
  to remember an additional manual policy-version stamp. Complete profile set
  serialization is normalized across process hash seeds; historical profile
  serialization is not rewritten.
- `ExecutorProvider` extends `LeasedCapability` with actual identity and cached
  unavailability reasons. `CapabilityDescriptor` compares profile canonical
  bytes and revision, checks kind/leased agreement, and refuses a provider
  hiding behind incomplete metadata. The same check serves assembly,
  admission, and description. No L2 filesystem or process probe is added.
- `SystemDescription` and its digest move to 3. Embedded Graph/admission stay
  1; manifests stay 2/3; SQLite stays 7. M7.1's published membership vocabulary
  remains unchanged. Strict version-2 readers refuse version 3.
- `Executor.execute` uses the existing `WorkspaceView | None`. One optional
  in-memory materialization callback extends `AcquiredCapability`; the walker
  awaits it after recording and cleanup enrollment. Resource identity is
  unchanged, and the existing checkpoint/disposition law decides cleanup.

The fake allocation ledger is explicitly a test instrument, not a new
Constructicon durable store. Reconstructed providers share it so local handle
state cannot stand in for a durable fence. Tests cover recording refusal,
never-started recovery, partial allocation, cancellation, earlier siblings,
ownership loss, and a new owner's fresh acquisition. A real control-plane
command and its RunHost also execute the complete fake through the lease.
InjectedCrash is a unit seam, not process-death or Linux containment evidence.

## Proof inventory and limits

The initial PR A head added 63 tests. Its 26-case mutation inventory in
`scripts/check_m8_mutations.py` independently removes grant checks, shared-law
and content identity, descriptor checks, availability, admission delegation,
record/materialize ordering, cleanup enrollment, inert-close discipline,
local reentry refusal, entry-before-await, and reconciliation of absence.
All 26 produced assertion failures on the implementation tested before review.
The posture assertion was tightened after its first mutant survived: the
isolation check alone was still refusing the request, so a generic "posture"
substring did not prove the selection check.

Mutation runners share one code-object instrument and never edit source files.
Its pytest hook distinguishes assertion failures from setup/collection errors,
unexpected exceptions, and harness timeouts. The M7.1 inventory now uses that
instrument too; its two description selectors follow the renamed test, its
baseline mutation selects the baseline block explicitly, and three assertions
name missing coordinates/incorrect pinned refusal instead of relying on an
incidental KeyError, StopIteration, or uncaught AdmissionError.

`scripts/check_m8_compatibility.py` exports the complete committed pre-M8
`src`, `tests`, and configuration into a disposable directory. Base and current
source both pass the seven-case compatibility suite: six exact manifest
goldens plus the empty-node refusal. Legacy fake profile bytes match exactly.
Both run with current interpreter/dependencies; this is not recreation of an
old dependency environment. The older provenance script additionally
reproduces seven historical endpoint manifests from `b5ff31f` and the empty-id
golden from `8262d4f`, using each historical validator with current dependencies.

Exact-head full-gate, CI, and independent-review results belong in the PR's
review record before readiness. A green baseline alone proves none of these
new laws; conversely, these contract tests prove no physical boundary.

## PR A review corrections

The independent review of `daf8577` reported two P1 lifecycle gaps. Both were
reproduced on that head before changing production code; the first regression
also demonstrated a cooperative cancel ignored during materialization.

1. A materializer can return normally after the heartbeat has observed that
   another owner claimed the run. The component was then invoked before its
   completion hit the journal fence. The existing `_check_run_control` now runs
   immediately after the await, before resource exposure. Tests pause a real
   materializer, expire/claim the actual run lease, wait for the actual heartbeat
   refusal, and require zero executor calls/checkpoints. The successor alone
   reconciles the old acquisition and completes under its fresh one. A
   cooperative cancellation at the same barrier must cancel, not succeed.
2. A second task cancellation could interrupt an enrolled acquisition's close.
   One `_finish_cleanup` mechanism now joins both unrecorded cleanup and the
   entire recorded batch, including each fenced journal transition. Shielding
   one resource at a time would still abandon siblings. The existing
   checkpoint/disposition law is unchanged: successful checkpoints retain
   release; unfinished work discards. An empty batch adds no scheduling point.
   Cleanup failure or ownership loss remains observable rather than being
   converted to cancellation or a false closed row.

`test_materialization_control.py` adds 12 barrier-based cases: observed
ownership/cooperative cancellation; repeated task cancellation during
materialization cleanup and post-checkpoint release; one or two acquisitions;
user cancellation versus shutdown abandonment; provider-close failure and
fenced-transition ownership loss followed by real successor reconciliation.
The last two queue cleanup completion before delivery of another cancellation,
proving the already-terminal cleanup result must still be observed. This
strengthening followed an initially surviving result-observation mutation;
ordinary await failure propagation had masked that separate guarantee.

The totals are 75 new PR A tests and 33 M8 mutations, all assertion-killed on
the corrected implementation. The seven new mutations remove post-await
control, recorded-batch shielding, shield isolation, repeated joining,
cancellation propagation, sibling coverage, and terminal failure observation
independently. Exact-head local/CI/review confirmation is recorded on PR #27;
these tests remain lifecycle proofs, not Linux process containment.

## Hosted-runner qualification — PR #28

PR #27 merged as `d5a8a94`. The owner selected standard GitHub Actions runners
instead of enabling virtualization on the Windows PC, then explicitly
authorized a scoped bubblewrap AppArmor profile on those disposable runners.
[Accepted ADR 0019](../../adr/0019-hosted-linux-runners-are-requalified-not-image-pinned.md)
separates the rolling host we observe from launch artifacts we control. That
evidence-location decision was accepted after PR #28 merged as `1b999be`:
the owner authorized PR B and its independent physical proof on these runners.
Accepted ADR 0018 and frozen rev 1 are unchanged; no PR B proof is inherited.

One credential-free workflow provisions a fixed Ubuntu bubblewrap package,
a non-sudo service account, and a reviewed profile attached only to a private,
root-owned executable copy. A separate non-root probe checks the exact kernel
profile stack, six namespace identities, service identity, read-only mount,
private loopback, missing host home/sysfs, reduced privileges, and refusal of
nested namespace creation and an unprofiled launch. Add-only loading,
absent-path guards, and unchanged global restrictions prevent silently replacing
policy. Nothing is installed on Windows or imported by Constructicon runtime.

The first two jobs refused because the host supplied no bubblewrap profile.
After operator authorization, the first profile loaded but its exec rule
requested an additional executable attachment search. The fixed named stack
removes that search entirely; it does not add an inheritance or unconfined
fallback. The next job launched with the expected enforcing stack and exposed
two incorrect probe assumptions: `--dev` uses an intermediate user namespace,
so the child map's parent-side zero is not host root; explicit AppArmor userns
denial reports EACCES rather than the global gate's possible EPERM. On this
kernel, the unprofiled copy creates namespaces but loses the capability needed
for loopback setup. Its refusal is recorded at that stage, not falsely at
namespace creation. The final checks name each operation and the pinned
mapping recipe.
Both corrections were traced to upstream source, not accepted merely to make
the probe pass. References and operation are in [the runbook](../../M8_CI.md).

The 52 portable tests and 20 assertion-killed mutations test the probe's
refusal logic, not Linux containment. Actual job links, image/commit evidence,
and exact-head gate results belong in PR #28. Its JSON always says
`runner_prerequisites_only` and `production_available: false`. The benign
diagnostic root borrows `/usr`; it is not PR B's pinned runtime. No hostile
process-tree cleanup, complete filesystem/FD exclusion, gateway, live model
call, or production availability is claimed by qualification.

## PR B — Linux containment and acquisition lifetime

The concrete networkless launcher, deferred READ/WRITE workspaces, permanent
Git closure marker, and retained acquisition guard merged in PR #30 as
`c39afe7033a259932dbf4110160501519b8710e0`, following PR #29 at `efe63c2`.
The merged tree matches reviewed head `ec43d128cfab417186afa72ae144396a46c88e7c`.
The trusted single-call subreaper keeps guard descriptors outside the payload's
PID namespace until its children are reaped; neither a Python controller's
death nor the bubblewrap monitor's return proves quiescence by itself.

The runtime is a curated immutable closure, not a mount of the host's `/usr`.
Provisioning moved from `/opt` to `/var/lib` after a hosted image's world-writable
`/opt` correctly failed the ancestor check. No check or host directory mode was
weakened to accommodate it. The service has no sudo or provider credentials.

An early independent review identified four concrete corrections: install the
supervisor source in that immutable closure; separate the 16 MiB artifact bound
from the 1 MiB task-input bound; include availability and spawn in the call's
deadline and elapsed observation; and keep deletion off the event loop while
retaining the acquisition guard through repeated cancellation and completion.
The Git export also drains after stopping its producer, so a full pipe cannot
strand bounded materialization cleanup. Bulk filesystem work and fixed
trusted-authority metadata calls use joined worker threads, never a legacy
Git importer or verifier.

The existing owner pipe now authorizes start only after the controller owns
the real spawn handle, then witnesses controller lifetime. A setup child
retains the acquisition guard while waiting; death before that authorization
cannot start a payload. The reaper also receives the remaining deadline in
the shared monotonic clock. It enforces expiry independently of asyncio,
including when the controller's event loop is stalled. Elapsed observation
includes setup and joined cleanup; expired cleanup cannot report success.
Shutdown gives the workload the plan's two-second TERM grace before forced
teardown. No additional backend authority is granted during cleanup. One
process-lifetime chain retains the guards until quiescence; it adds no graph
scheduler, persistent PID ledger, or journal phase.

The runtime digest and retained inventory use one projection. Symlinks cannot
reach executable content outside that immutable closure. The physical proof
records six namespaces, single-ID UID/GID maps, exact minimal devices,
no-new-privileges, zero effective capabilities, process limits, private mounts,
an allowlisted environment, and only standard payload descriptors. The pinned
bubblewrap emits `/dev/core` as a legacy `/proc/kcore` alias; the assertion
requires that exact link and proves opening it is denied, rather than claiming
the name is absent. No kernel memory is read by this test.

Native regressions cover READ refusal, WRITE confinement, host file/socket/FD
exclusion, private network, hostile detached descendants and held pipes,
timeouts, repeated cancellation, controller death during setup and execution,
and real control-plane deaths before recording, after recording, and during
materialization. Recovery proves exact closure and epoch separation. A
recorded-subprocess Executor double exercises the same task, grant, lease,
workspace and outcome contracts without a provider request.

The required CI lane uses the actual non-sudo service user. Its artifacts retain
the exact runtime inventory/digest, bubblewrap and AppArmor policy/ABI digests,
commit, observed runner/kernel/service facts, and the child boundary projection.
They contain no host environment dump or credentials and expire after seven
days. [The runbook](../../M8_CI.md) distinguishes this from qualification.
Windows skips remain explicitly not physical evidence. Exact-head local/CI,
mutation, compatibility and independent-review results are recorded on PR #30
before readiness, not inferred from the implementation's existence.

### Mutation coverage and independent defensive strength

The native inventory removes READ mount protection, network isolation,
workspace mount selection, runtime link containment, deadline transfer,
start ordering, elapsed accounting, export bounds, permanent-closure checks,
literal sentinel semantics, the closure transaction, physical serialization,
revocation-before-wait ordering, and deletion cancellation/loop discipline.
Network/visibility payloads additionally test the recipe directly after
artifact validation, so an availability refusal cannot masquerade as proof
that an attempted escape was physically stopped. Only assertion failures
count; setup errors and harness timeouts do not.

Some checks are intentionally redundant and are not independently credited:
the controller's spawn timeout is now backed by the reaper's transferred
deadline; post-wait local view checks are backed by the durable closure check;
and bubblewrap's parent-death mechanism is backed by the external reaper's
exact-child termination. In-memory controller mutations do not modify the
installed immutable reaper. Its descendant-reap and inherited-guard code is
proved by actual stopped-reaper/controller-death experiments, not falsely
claimed as independently mutation-killed source. Killing the trusted reaper
itself, kernel compromise, and aggregate multi-tenant resource isolation are
not promised. Per-process limits do not establish a tenant-wide quota.

### PR B confirming-review corrections

Review of `78d83c8` found three additional defects. A start byte buffered before
owner death arrived as `POLLIN | POLLHUP`; consuming the byte discarded the
observed death. The supervisor now refuses HUP/ERR before process creation.
A native fork test inherits the actual function and observes whether Popen
is reached with a real buffered-and-closed pipe. Its code-object mutation
discriminates that branch without racing a payload against its later kill.
This is a native owner-pipe law proof, not a rewrite of the installed reaper.

The recorded double now captures and checks the exact program against its
admitted configuration digest after acquiring both guards; the same local
string enters the command. Launch-revision checking also occurs after the
workspace wait. A changed recording cannot run behind an old identity. The
decoder counts actual malformed/contradictory records separately from a byte
bound or missing terminal result: those conditions alone invent no malformed
record. Dedicated regressions and three additional mutations cover these
corrections. Final exact-head confirmation remains the PR's gate.

Review of `999fe7e` found that availability still transferred its independent
ten-second deadline to the reaper and that launcher fields could be reloaded
across the probe await. The launch configuration is now one frozen value;
reconfiguration creates a new value, never changes an admitted call midway.
Identity-bearing changes also change its revision; relocating identical
artifacts does not. Each configurable field has a refusal test. Immutability is
the standard dataclass contract, not an independently mutated custom guard.
`run` passes its deadline through `probe` to that same reaper. Standalone
qualification alone supplies a default deadline. A native probe emits its
actual namespace observation, then stalls; a pidfd proves its reaper exits
on the caller deadline even while the controller event loop is blocked.
Removing the deadline transfer is a separate native mutation. Expiry is
reported as timeout rather than as an unrelated prerequisite failure.

Review of `b8256a6` found synchronous runtime hashing before the probe's first
await. Artifact verification now uses the existing owned-work join around a
read-only worker thread. Heartbeats and cancellation remain deliverable while
storage is busy. Expiry or repeated cancellation joins that worker before
returning and cannot start a probe or payload afterward. This is not a hard
wall-clock bound on a stalled host filesystem: joining an in-progress read is
cleanup latency, not additional authorized execution. A portable barrier test
proves both responsiveness and ownership; moving hashing back onto the loop
or abandoning the worker on cancellation is independently assertion-killed.
Native tests continue to validate the actual artifacts and launch recipe.

Review of `e97f762` identified the same event-loop hazard in READ archive
extraction. Extraction now joins its filesystem worker before releasing the
acquisition guard, including repeated cancellation. A native barrier proves
that the loop stays responsive, another guard holder cannot enter early, and
the actual archive writes finish before the cancelled materializer returns.
Synchronous extraction and an unjoined worker are separate mutations.

The same audit covered the newly introduced trusted metadata boundaries:
base-ref resolution, guarded closure checks at materialization/use, and the
closure-marker transaction. They now join off-loop work as well. Revocation
still commits before waiting for the guard; a cancellation during that write
can leave a closed, unreconciled acquisition for retry, never false disposal.
The four boundary cases each test responsiveness and repeated-cancellation
ownership, with one mutation for each guarantee. These fixed, bounded Git
plumbing calls operate only on the trusted authority. No hostile staging
importer or gate verifier is wrapped in a thread, and no legacy API changes.
Small fixed-count guard/path syscalls remain synchronous; repository-sized
processing and subprocess waits do not run on the event loop.

Review of `f9236c7` rejected the recorded immediate-KILL deviation from the
frozen shutdown default. TERM must reach the workload, not bubblewrap's
monitor: the pinned monitor's parent-death behavior otherwise kills namespace
init before a cooperative child can flush. A small trusted PID-1 shim now
replaces bubblewrap's built-in init. The external reaper retains the guards;
one private lifetime socket links it to the shim, which inherits neither guard
nor controller pipe. The shim closes private descriptors in the actual child
and disables dumpability so that child cannot inspect its descriptors/memory.
Both roles reuse one reaping loop and one non-renewable two-second shutdown
state. Namespace-wide TERM/KILL is guarded by the private-PID-1 precondition;
the external fallback still signals only exact children through pidfds.
See the pinned [bubblewrap implementation](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/blob/v0.9.0/bubblewrap.c).

Native tests require cooperative output flushing on timeout, cancellation and
output-bound teardown, bounded escalation for TERM-ignoring work, descriptor
privacy, and the existing descendant/owner-death proofs. Portable policy tests
independently mutation-check grace duration, non-renewal, TERM/KILL selection,
and the PID guard. These policy mutants do not rewrite installed immutable
code; actual signal delivery and cleanup remain mandatory native proofs.

The first grace-enabled native run passed all 112 tests but exposed one
surviving elapsed-time mutant: a slower payload alone could satisfy the old
absolute threshold. The test now observes the real probe and payload spans
separately and requires the returned total to include both. No launch result
or OS observation is fabricated, and the threshold is not merely increased.

Review of `ab6daf8` found that the external fallback started its grace before
namespace init delivered TERM. Stop requests now carry no grace timestamp.
The private socket's write-half closure requests shutdown; trusted PID 1
acknowledges the actual TERM send time in one atomic record. Both reapers use
that same timestamp, and repeated requests or acknowledgements never renew it.
The payload inherits no endpoint and cannot inspect init's private descriptors.
Without acknowledgement the external reaper neither invents a clock nor
releases guards over living descendants. A stalled trusted init can delay
cleanup; it cannot turn missing evidence into quiescence.

A native regression stops the exact namespace init through a pidfd, cancels
the call, and waits beyond the old fallback window. Init must remain alive and
the acquisition guard held. After continuation, the real TERM handler takes
one second to flush successfully before teardown. The portable shutdown-law
test also delays acknowledgement and independently kills a mutation that
starts grace at request time. The native fixture, not that policy mutation,
proves the installed immutable reapers exchange the timestamp correctly.

### Post-merge correction: deterministic spawn-order evidence

The README wording correction in PR #32 (`d35ae85`) exposed a gap in the existing
mutation proof. All 113 native tests passed, but `payload start before spawn
ownership` survived: the test sampled a workspace marker after 300 ms, so
slow process startup could hide an already-authorized payload. Neither the
launcher nor the mutation had changed in that PR.

The corrected test records the real owner-pipe writes and native spawn-handle
returns. Device/inode identity joins each writer to the inherited read end;
reused descriptor numbers cannot confuse the probe with the workload. Both
operations still call the OS unchanged. Assertions run after the real workload
completes and cleanup joins. For each native handle, the first successful start
write must follow handoff: a later lawful duplicate cannot hide an early write,
and duplicate counting cannot substitute for the ordering proof.

Two payloads exercise the same assertion. One writes directly; the other waits
for stdin, which the controller supplies only after handle return. The latter
deliberately hides the file effect of premature authorization, so marker
absence cannot be credited as evidence. No fixed observation delay, mocked OS
return, or production protocol change is used. This proves controller-side
authorization ordering; the unmodified native reaper and lifetime tests remain
responsible for enforcement and cleanup. Windows skips are not native evidence;
exact-head Linux and mutation results belong in the follow-up PR.

### Backend extensibility and subscription intent

The owner reaffirmed that Claude Code, Codex, and Pi are the starting adapters,
with future cloud and local models using the same task-shaped executor seam.
This follows ADR 0005: API models enter through a compatible harness, not a
completion-level provider abstraction in the kernel. No CLI-specific base
class, provider enum, model switch in the walker, or alternate workspace
contract is required by this launcher. Adapter profiles and launch identity
continue to state exactly what is supported and enforced.

The owner's primary solo-developer motivation includes subscription reuse.
That intent does not establish a working or authorized authentication route:
accepted ADR 0018 still requires gateway-only initial authentication. Resolving
subscription-backed access is an explicit prerequisite decision before the
live Claude Code/Codex slices, not something PR B claims or silently enables.
The [authentication feasibility record](../../designs/EXECUTOR_AUTHENTICATION.md)
separates documented native CLI login from credential intermediation. It
now links the owner-authorized
[native-authentication investigation](M8-native-auth-feasibility.md): pinned
Hardline source, published CLI interfaces, and credential-free Codex schema
generation. These establish possible integration points, not complete native
tool mediation or subscription availability. The proposed next experiment
keeps scripted driver proof separate from actual native CLI proof. No successor
ADR, credential access, or changed authentication policy follows from it.

## Remaining slices and operator prerequisites

PR B completed its physical proofs under the actual Linux service account and
pinned containment policy on GitHub Actions. Its final head passed the local
gate (1,699 passed, 72 skipped), CI gate (1,720 passed, 51 skipped), native lane
(113 passed), and mutation inventory (42 killed); confirming review reported
no actionable findings. These are PR B evidence, not proof of a native model
adapter or gateway. Hosted-runner qualification alone still supplies only
prerequisite evidence. The Windows machine remains unchanged; no gateway,
secret access, paid request, or account login has been authorized.

C: safe async WRITE capture. D: contained async gates. E: selected gateway
integration and deployment-specific conformance. F/G/H: Claude Code, Codex,
then Pi and integrated closeout.
No live WRITE profile is enabled before capture, gates, and routed authority
are proved. The public model contracts are not substitutes for those proofs.
